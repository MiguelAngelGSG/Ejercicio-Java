First i've searched the definition and usage of all the parametres and variables used in a pre-solved exercise.
Once I understood the tools used in this exercise and with help from classmates I created this APP that asks you to input your weight and height, then calculates your BMI with a simple math calculus and compares the result of your BMI with the registered standards to return your estimated health.
